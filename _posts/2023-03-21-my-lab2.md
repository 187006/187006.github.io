Honeypot 

For the Honeypot I had some issues here are the pictures of that issues I tried my best to solve them but couldn't so I thought I find some picture form the internet and try to explain them step by step.

### Pictures form the Internet

Pentbox is a safety package with multiple tools for carrying out PenTest's job more efficiently.  

    ./pentbox.rb

after that these windows gonna open and you can choose between the tools:

after we chose Honeypot 
The fake port can now be opened as well a fake message can be entered. You can also choose to save the log and its name. You can see when the honeypot is active on the specified port, and you can manually activate honeypots on extra ports.

After that, they started to scan the host machine with the attacker machine and by using the nmap command they got an open port displayed.

 then the attacker tries to  connect  using telnet  command

 for every attempt, the host machine gets the information from the attacker's IP and port.

  ## Reflection 
  
 Unfortunately, I couldn't perform the lab by myself, but I found a website that conducted an exercise with Honeypots, and I thought it could provide me with some insights into how they work.

I learned that Honeypots can have a significant impact on cybersecurity within a company. For example, they can be used as training and information-gathering tools. They help train individuals who are new to cybersecurity by showcasing how attacks work and what precautions need to be taken. Additionally, Honeypots can gather information about malicious behavior in the system, including attacker patterns, malware strains, and actively exploited vulnerabilities.

However, it's important to note that Honeypots are not perfect. One limitation is their cost, as setting up and maintaining a system that mimics a company's network requires specialized skills. Moreover, while Honeypots expose resources, they are designed to deny attackers access to actual systems.

Overall, my research on Honeypots was intriguing, as I wasn't aware of their existence before. The concept of a Honeypot is fascinating, although it's worth mentioning that experienced hackers can sometimes detect them.
