| 1. Reconnaissance     |Attackers likely carried out investigations on SolarWinds' system, infrastructure, and software development actions to discover possible weaknesses and targets of significant value. | Execute solid security education programs and restrict openly accessible knowledge regarding your organization's infrastructure. Keep track of suspicious behavior on public forums as well as social networks.| Receive information on potential threats and ongoing efforts via threat intelligence tools. Companies are able to remain updated on new threats with the assistance of tools like CrowdStrike Recon or Recorded Future.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2. Weaponization  |The attackers built a unique backdoor and added it to the SolarWinds Orion software, which eventually received the nickname "SUNBURST". As a component of a software update that was subsequently sent to customers, the backdoor was made weaponized.| Apply the latest and most recent security patches to your software and systems, and use application whitelisting to avoid unauthorized software from running.|To identify vulnerabilities in your software and infrastructure, use vulnerability scanning tools like Nessus or Tenable.                                                                                                                                              |
| 3. Delivery  |The SolarWinds software update system was utilized for spreading the malware payload. Clients who unknowingly applied the compromised update installed the SUNBURST backdoor on their computers.| frequently check the reliability of software updates before installing them. Classify your computer system to avoid malware from spreading more deeply. |Use software for digitally signing as well as verifying software updates, such as PGP OpenSSL. To detect uncommon traffic patterns or irregularities that might be related to a compromised update.                |
| 4. Exploitation           | Once the malicious update was installed, the SUNBURST backdoor provided attackers with remote access to the affected systems. This allowed them to exploit the systems and establish a persistent presence.   | Regularly scan for and remediate vulnerabilities in your systems. Implement strong access controls and limit the use of privileged accounts. | Use intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) like Snort or Suricata to monitor and block potential exploits. Employ endpoint protection solutions like CrowdStrike Falcon or Microsoft Defender ATP to detect and block known exploits and malware.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5. Installation           | The SUNBURST backdoor was installed on the target systems as part of the malicious software update. This enabled the attackers to maintain a persistent presence on the compromised systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Establish a baseline of normal system behavior and monitor for deviations. Implement strong endpoint protection and response capabilities. | Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools like Carbon Black or SentinelOne to detect and respond to potential threats on endpoints. Employ security information and event management (SIEM) solutions like Splunk or LogRhythm for centralized log collection and analysis.                                                                                                                               |
| 6. Command and Control (C2) | After successful installation, the SUNBURST backdoor communicated with the attackers' command and control (C2) infrastructure, allowing them to remotely control the compromised systems and execute further malicious activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Block known malicious IP addresses and domain names. Regularly review and update firewall and proxy rules. Monitor outbound traffic for unusual patterns. | Use network security monitoring tools like Wireshark or Zeek to capture and analyze network traffic. Implement domain name system (DNS) filtering and security solutions like Cisco Umbrella or DNSFilter to block access to known malicious domains.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7. Actions on Objectives  | Attackers used their access to the compromised systems to exfiltrate sensitive data, move laterally within the network, and potentially cause further damage. In the case of the SolarWinds exploit, the exact objectives varied depending on the specific targets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Continuously monitor for signs of data exfiltration and lateral movement. Implement a robust incident response plan and practice it regularly. | Use data loss prevention (DLP) tools like Symantec DLP or Digital Guardian to detect and prevent unauthorized data transfers. Employ network analysis tools like Vectra Cognito or Darktrace for detecting lateral movement and other advanced threats. Implement and practice an incident response plan using tools like TheHive or IBM Resilient for efficient coordination and response. |
