| 1. Reconnaissance     |Attackers likely carried out investigations on SolarWinds' system, infrastructure, and software development actions to discover possible weaknesses and targets of significant value. | Execute solid security education programs and restrict openly accessible knowledge regarding your organization's infrastructure. Keep track of suspicious behavior on public forums as well as social networks.| Receive information on potential threats and ongoing efforts via threat intelligence tools. Companies are able to remain updated on new threats with the assistance of tools like CrowdStrike Recon or Recorded Future.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2. Weaponization  |The attackers built a unique backdoor and added it to the SolarWinds Orion software, which eventually received the nickname "SUNBURST". As a component of a software update that was subsequently sent to customers, the backdoor was made weaponized.| Apply the latest and most recent security patches to your software and systems, and use application whitelisting to avoid unauthorized software from running.|To identify vulnerabilities in your software and infrastructure, use vulnerability scanning tools like Nessus or Tenable.                                                                                                                                              |
| 3. Delivery  |The SolarWinds software update system was utilized for spreading the malware payload. Clients who unknowingly applied the compromised update installed the SUNBURST backdoor on their computers.| frequently check the reliability of software updates before installing them. Classify your computer system to avoid malware from spreading more deeply. |Use software for digitally signing as well as verifying software updates, such as PGP OpenSSL. To detect uncommon traffic patterns or irregularities that might be related to a compromised update.                |
| 4. Exploitation           |The SUNBURST backdoor provided attackers with unauthorized access to all affected systems once the malicious update had been installed. As a result of this, they've been able to take advantage of the systems to establish a lasting presence. | Frequently check your systems for weaknesses and resolve them. Limit the usage of privileged accounts and place strong access controls. | Make use of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), such as Snort or Suricata, to maintain a watch out to identify and stop potential exploits. Use endpoint protection tools such as CrowdStrike Falcon or Microsoft Defender ATP to detect and prevent identified vulnerabilities as well as malware.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5. Installation |The malicious software update contained the SUNBURST backdoor, that had been set in place on the target systems. The following made it possible for the hackers to stay active on the systems that were infected.   | Establish an expectation for typical system functioning along with monitor over errors. Set up effectively to ensure that the response and security measures. |To identify and deal with potential endpoint threats, use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools like CrowdStrike. For the centrally managed recording of logs as well as analysis, employ security information and event administration (SIEM) tools like LogRhythm.                                                                                                                               |
| 6. Command and Control (C2) | The SUNBURST backdoor communicated through the attackers' control and command, which infrastructure after successful installation, allows them to gain access to the infected systems and carry out additional malicious activities.|Stop all recognized malicious domains along with IP addresses. Check and make changes to the firewall and proxy rules regularly. Maintain a watch out for odd patterns in the outgoing traffic. | To keep track of and inspect network traffic, use tools for network security monitoring such as Wireshark                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7. Actions on Objectives  |Hackers got around the computer system and possibly did additional damage while using their privileges with regard to the compromised systems to steal sensitive information.  | Maintain a watch out for lateral motion along with signs of data exfiltration. Develop an extensive emergency response plan and frequently test it. | To locate and prevent unauthorized data transfers, use data loss prevention, or DLP, tools like Symantec DLP. |
