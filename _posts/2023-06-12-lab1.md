| 1. Reconnaissance         | Adversaries likely conducted research on SolarWinds' network, infrastructure, and software development practices to identify potential vulnerabilities and high-value targets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Implement robust security awareness training and limit publicly available information about your organization's infrastructure. Monitor for suspicious activities on public forums and social media. | Use threat intelligence tools to gather information on potential threats and active campaigns. Tools like Recorded Future or ThreatConnect can help organizations stay informed about emerging threats.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2. Weaponization          | The attackers created a custom backdoor, later dubbed 'SUNBURST', and inserted it into the SolarWinds Orion software. This backdoor was weaponized as part of a software update, which was then distributed to customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Keep software and systems up-to-date with the latest security patches, and use application whitelisting to block unauthorized software from running. | Utilize vulnerability scanning tools, such as Nessus or Qualys, to identify weaknesses in your software and infrastructure. Employ static and dynamic code analysis tools like Veracode or Fortify to catch security vulnerabilities during the development process.                                                                                                                                              |
| 3. Delivery               | The delivery of the malicious payload was carried out through the SolarWinds software update system. Customers who installed the compromised update unknowingly introduced the SUNBURST backdoor into their systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Regularly validate and verify the integrity of software updates before deployment. Implement network segmentation to limit the potential spread of malware. | Employ tools like GnuPG or OpenSSL to digitally sign and verify software updates. Use network monitoring tools like Wireshark or Zeek (formerly Bro) to detect unusual traffic patterns or anomalies that might indicate a compromised update.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4. Exploitation           | Once the malicious update was installed, the SUNBURST backdoor provided attackers with remote access to the affected systems. This allowed them to exploit the systems and establish a persistent presence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Regularly scan for and remediate vulnerabilities in your systems. Implement strong access controls and limit the use of privileged accounts. | Use intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) like Snort or Suricata to monitor and block potential exploits. Employ endpoint protection solutions like CrowdStrike Falcon or Microsoft Defender ATP to detect and block known exploits and malware.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5. Installation           | The SUNBURST backdoor was installed on the target systems as part of the malicious software update. This enabled the attackers to maintain a persistent presence on the compromised systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Establish a baseline of normal system behavior and monitor for deviations. Implement strong endpoint protection and response capabilities. | Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools like Carbon Black or SentinelOne to detect and respond to potential threats on endpoints. Employ security information and event management (SIEM) solutions like Splunk or LogRhythm for centralized log collection and analysis.                                                                                                                               |
| 6. Command and Control (C2) | After successful installation, the SUNBURST backdoor communicated with the attackers' command and control (C2) infrastructure, allowing them to remotely control the compromised systems and execute further malicious activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Block known malicious IP addresses and domain names. Regularly review and update firewall and proxy rules. Monitor outbound traffic for unusual patterns. | Use network security monitoring tools like Wireshark or Zeek to capture and analyze network traffic. Implement domain name system (DNS) filtering and security solutions like Cisco Umbrella or DNSFilter to block access to known malicious domains.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7. Actions on Objectives  | Attackers used their access to the compromised systems to exfiltrate sensitive data, move laterally within the network, and potentially cause further damage. In the case of the SolarWinds exploit, the exact objectives varied depending on the specific targets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Continuously monitor for signs of data exfiltration and lateral movement. Implement a robust incident response plan and practice it regularly. | Use data loss prevention (DLP) tools like Symantec DLP or Digital Guardian to detect and prevent unauthorized data transfers. Employ network analysis tools like Vectra Cognito or Darktrace for detecting lateral movement and other advanced threats. Implement and practice an incident response plan using tools like TheHive or IBM Resilient for efficient coordination and response. |

There areno phases in the SolarWinds exploit where I cannot identify any activities or potential mitigations. While the specific details of some activities might not be publicly available, a general understanding of the attack can be inferred from the information that has been disclosed.

Please note that the tools mentioned in the table are examples and not exhaustive. The tools that are best suited for an organization will depend on its specific needs, infrastructure, and budget, among other factors.
