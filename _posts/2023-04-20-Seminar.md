### Refleciton:
The session provided us with a wonderful opportunity to learn more about ARDUINO and to see some of its real-world applications. Our special guest educator expertly led us through a variety of experiments so that we could comprehend the fundamentals and operation of ARDUINO boards. We got the opportunity to investigate various sensors, actuators, and coding approaches, which increased our knowledge of electronics and programming.


The seminar was extremely enjoyable and educational because of how engaging it was. The instructor's enthusiasm and knowledge inspired us, piqued our curiosity, and led to a number of thought-provoking debates. We obtained a deeper grasp of how ARDUINO can be used to develop creative ideas and automate various procedures through practical experimentation.

Overall, the session was a priceless learning opportunity that broadened our perspectives on ARDUINO. It not only improved our technical abilities but also encouraged us to investigate further options in this fascinating sector. We are appreciative of the chance to learn from a teacher with such extensive experience and anticipate using what we learned in our future activities.
