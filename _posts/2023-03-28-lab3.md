### Reflection

When I first conducted a DDoS attack, I was surprised by how easy it could be to overload a website. The attack was launched with just a few clicks and a few lines of code. What was even more concerning was the ease with which an evil actor might keep up the attack. I became aware of how vulnerable websites are to DDoS attacks and how simple it is for anyone to carry out one as a result.

The simplicity with which DDoS attacks can be conducted is indeed scary. Anyone can launch an attack due to an abundance of tools and techniques on the internet. It involves a lot more than just shutting down a website; it additionally includes possible damage to a company's reputation and loss of customers.
DDoS attacks can also be used as a decoy to hide data exfiltration or to divert defenders from other attacks. As a result, they are effective weapons in the hands of villains.
In conclusion, I want to stress how seriously I take website security after my DDoS attack experience. In order to detect and respond to such attacks, it is important to have the proper processes and training in place in addition to the appropriate technology. As responsible internet users, it is our responsibility to be aware of the dangers posed by such attacks and to take the necessary precautions to safeguard both our personal and professional information.
