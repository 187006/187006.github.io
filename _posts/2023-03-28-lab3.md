### Reflection

When I first performed a DDoS attack, I was surprised by how easy it was to overload a website. Just a few mouse clicks and a few lines of code were required to start the attack. What was even more concerning was how easily an evil actor might carry on the attack. As a result, I learned how easily anybody can launch a DDoS attack and how vulnerable websites are to them.

DDoS attacks are frightening because they are so easy to carry out. Since there are so many tools and tactics available online, anyone can launch an attack. It involves a lot more than just shutting down a website; it can also result in customer loss and negative publicity for a business. DDoS attacks may also be used as an elaborate scheme for covering up data espionage or to distract security personnel from other threats. They are therefore powerful tools in the hands of bad actors.

Finally, I want to emphasize how important it is to have protection 
ready or be prepared in the case of such an attack. It is crucial to have the right procedures, training, and technological advances in place to recognize and respond to such attacks. It is scary how easily such a massive attack can happen. I watched a German YouTube video about such an attack with a Mirai botnet. The Mirai botnet is a malware-type botnet that primarily targets IoT devices. I will post the link below, but please note that it is in German. The DDoS attack that I am referring to happened on October 21, 2016, affecting almost the entire eastern side of the USA. The internet stopped or slowed down, and even some parts of Europe were affected by this attack. It is really scary that something that can cause that much damage can be created so easily.


I had some issues in this lab like you can see  on this  picture:
