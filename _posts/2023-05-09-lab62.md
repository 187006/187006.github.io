| Phase               | SolarWinds Exploit Analysis    | Possible Mitigations      | Suggested Tools and Reasons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 1. Reconnaissance     |Attackers likely carried out investigations on SolarWinds' system, infrastructure, and software development actions to discover possible weaknesses and targets of significant value. | Execute solid security education programs and restrict openly accessible knowledge regarding your organization's infrastructure. Keep track of suspicious behavior on public forums as well as social networks.| Receive information on potential threats and ongoing efforts via threat intelligence tools. Companies are able to remain updated on new threats with the assistance of tools like CrowdStrike Recon.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2. Weaponization  |The attackers built a unique backdoor and added it to the SolarWinds Orion software, which eventually received the nickname "SUNBURST". As a component of a software update that was subsequently sent to customers, the backdoor was made weaponized.| Apply the latest and most recent security patches to your software and systems, and use application whitelisting to avoid unauthorized software from running.|To identify vulnerabilities in your software and infrastructure, use vulnerability scanning tools like Tenable.                                                                                                                                              |
| 3. Delivery  |The SolarWinds software update system was utilized for spreading the malware payload. Clients who unknowingly applied the compromised update installed the SUNBURST backdoor on their computers.| frequently check the reliability of software updates before installing them. Classify your computer system to avoid malware from spreading more deeply. |Use software for digitally signing as well as verifying software updates, such as PGP OpenSSL. To detect uncommon traffic patterns or irregularities that might be related to a compromised update.                |
| 4. Exploitation           |The SUNBURST backdoor provided attackers with unauthorized access to all affected systems once the malicious update had been installed. As a result of this, they've been able to take advantage of the systems to establish a lasting presence. | Frequently check your systems for weaknesses and resolve them. Limit the usage of privileged accounts and place strong access controls. | Make use of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), such as Suricata, to maintain a watch out to identify and stop potential exploits.                                                                                                                                     |
| 5. Installation |The malicious software update contained the SUNBURST backdoor, that had been set in place on the target systems. The following made it possible for the hackers to stay active on the systems that were infected.   | Establish an expectation for typical system functioning along with monitor over errors. Set up effectively to ensure that the response and security measures. |To identify and deal with potential endpoint threats, use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools like CrowdStrike.                                                                                                                             |
| 6. Command and Control (C2) | The SUNBURST backdoor communicated through the attackers' control and command, which infrastructure after successful installation, allows them to gain access to the infected systems and carry out additional malicious activities.|Stop all recognized malicious domains along with IP addresses. Check and make changes to the firewall and proxy rules regularly. Maintain a watch out for odd patterns in the outgoing traffic. | To keep track of and inspect network traffic, use tools for network security monitoring such as Wireshark                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7. Actions on Objectives  |Hackers got around the computer system and possibly did additional damage while using their privileges with regard to the compromised systems to steal sensitive information.  | Maintain a watch out for lateral motion along with signs of data exfiltration. Develop an extensive emergency response plan and frequently test it. | To locate and prevent unauthorized data transfers, use data loss prevention, or DLP, tools like Symantec DLP. |


### Reflection

Understanding how cyberattacks operate is fascinating because it allows us to be proactive in preventing and reducing them. We can help ourselves in this regard by being familiar with the idea of cyber death chains. The stages or steps of a typical cyber attack, from the initial reconnaissance to the final exploitation, are referred to as the "cyber kill chain." We can discover possible weaknesses and create powerful defense strategies by understanding these stages.
Knowing the different steps in a cyber death chain enables us to properly anticipate and block each stage. We may put preventative measures into place and improve our security posture by comprehending the attacker's mindset and techniques. We can strengthen defenses, identify potential attack routes, and implement the proper security measures at each level of the kill chain thanks to this knowledge.
It's critical to stay up to date on new attack methodologies and the shifting threat landscape. You may improve your capacity to recognize, react to, and effectively neutralize possible cyber threats by maintaining an up-to-date awareness of cyber death chains and being proactive with our security measures.
