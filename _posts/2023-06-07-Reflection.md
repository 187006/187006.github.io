I had a lot of fun learning new stuff. It was also interesting to gain new experience in this field. I didn't have any previous knowledge about IoT or cybersecurity, so I learned a lot of new things that I think will help me in my life.

What I did and learned:

Creating the e-portfolio was a new, interesting, and somewhat difficult task, but I had fun doing it. I learned about Kali and all the scanning commands that we had in class, as well as Wireshark. It was really interesting to see how all of that worked.

In terms of cybersecurity, I learned about scanning tools, Wireshark, honeypots, possible threats to the industry, and their mitigations. I also learned about firewalls, types of attacks, the STRIDE and DREAD frameworks, and the CIA and AAA models.

Regarding IoT, I didn't know it was such a big aspect of our lives before this class. I learned what it is, its building blocks, its uses, the fields in which it is used, and how it improves our lives.

Overall, it was fun and interesting. The portfolio was a new experience for me, and I used the opportunity to gain more knowledge about cybersecurity and IoT, as well as to increase my general knowledge in this field. I won't say it was easy, but I had fun. The meetings with my classmates helped me see things in a new light, and I also had help from AI for spelling and with the grammar. It was fun to learn, and I hope that with all of this, I can reach the next level and learn more about IoT, maybe even start a career in this direction.
