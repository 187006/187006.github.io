### Reflection
Since I had no prior knowledge of Linux, the tasks at the time were unfamiliar and had no idea how to proceed, I initially ran into several obstacles that I found difficult to overcome. It took me quite a bit of effort to understand some of the tasks because I was uncertain of what was required from me and some of them seemed new to me. But I was able to discover solutions after carrying out a lot of research, and in the end, everything worked out. I have to say that learning new information about Linux and the commands was both difficult and enjoyable, particularly in an area where I am relatively inexperienced.
