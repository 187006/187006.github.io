### Reflection
Since I had no prior knowledge of the tasks at the time and had no idea how to proceed, I initially ran into several obstacles that I found difficult to overcome. I didnâ€™t know exactly what was expected of me, and some of the tasks were so unfamiliar to me that it took a lot of effort for me to understand them. But after extensive testing and research, I was able to find the answers, and everything turned out in the end. I have to admit that learning new material was both difficult and rewarding, especially in this field where I lack much experience.
