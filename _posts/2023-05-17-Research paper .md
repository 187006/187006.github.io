### Summary of the Research paper


The Research paper addresses the development of information security in the modern day of digital technology into cyber security in addition to the rising risks that businesses must contend with. It highlights the need for strong safety measures to ward off online threats. In the digital economy, which consists of new business models, markets, goods, and services based on digital technologies, companies are adopting a variety of digital advancements like cloud computing, mobile technology, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), robotics, and others. These technologies' capacity to integrate goods, services, and processes provides them with the potential to change existing business models.

Digital technologies have focused on the outside world, allowing remaining digital services and improved consumer experiences, compared to information technology (IT) efforts which focus on internal operations. Because they believe that IT and digital technology will assist businesses in increasingly strategic ways, managers now place a high priority on digitization. The implementation of innovative digital technologies exposes businesses to additional risks, especially the ones caused by cybersecurity incidents.

There's a misunderstanding about how security incidents involving information systems (IS) as well as the general business environment are different. In addition to underlying IT and digital technologies, the writers argue that IS should be seen as a crucial part of the business and its risk, control, and security environment. They generate attention to the evolution of security incidents, from straightforward internal IT issues to more complicated and global cyberattacks. The expense of cyber security incidents, like breaches of data, state-sponsored attacks, and disruption of critical infrastructure, is highlighted in the report as a matter of both financial losses and public image. It emphasizes the significance of handling cyber security holistically and the requirement for both essential and innovative security controls to identify and prevent advanced threats. In their initial research, the authors examined several important Croatian companies. Researchers utilized structured, in-depth interviews with information/cyber security experts as well as questionnaires for surveys to evaluate the efficacy of the security controls put in place by these companies.

To successfully handle cyber security, organizations need to implement a comprehensive strategy which involves both essential security against common attacks and innovative safety measures to identify and address advanced and new threats. The research points out recent developments in cyber security, including the complexity of attacks growing, the financial gain of cybercrime, state-sponsored attacks, and worries over skills and capabilities. The writers additionally highlight the significance of frequently reviewing and enhancing the effectiveness of security protocols. It clearly states that businesses linked to important or necessary national infrastructure are especially vulnerable to online attacks. Therefore, it is essential to investigate and implement control measures to lower these risks.

Overall it is essential for businesses to give priority to cyber security in the modern era, provided the complexity and competence of cyberattacks and their possible effects on company operations, data privacy, reputation, and national security.
