### Summary of the Research paper


The Research paper addresses the evolution of information security in the age of digital technology into cyber security as well as the rising risks that businesses must contend with. It highlights the necessity of strong security measures to fend against online threats.
Organizations are adopting various digital advancements like cloud computing, mobile technology, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), robotics, and others in the digital economy, which includes new business models, markets, goods, and services based on digital technologies. These technologies' ability to integrate goods, services, and processes gives them the potential to upend existing business models.

Digital technologies are externally focused, enabling outstanding digital services and improved consumer experiences, in contrast to information technology (IT) initiatives that concentrate on internal operations. Leaders now place a high importance on digital transformation because they anticipate that IT and digital technology will help firms in increasingly strategic ways. Adoption of cutting-edge digital technologies exposes businesses to additional risks, particularly those posed by cyber security events.

There is a misunderstanding about how security incidents involving information systems (IS) and the general business environment are distinct. The authors contend that IS should be viewed as an integral component of the business and its risk, control, and security environment, together with underlying IT and digital technologies. They draw attention to how security incidents are evolving, shifting from simple internal IT problems to more complex and international cyberattacks.
The report highlights the considerable economic and reputational costs associated with cyber security incidents, such as data breaches, state-sponsored assaults, and interruption of vital infrastructure. It underlines the need of managing cyber security comprehensively and the necessity of both fundamental security measures and cutting-edge security controls to identify and counter sophisticated threats.
The authors examined a selection of significant Croatian businesses as part of their preliminary investigation. To assess the effectiveness of security controls established by these firms, researchers employed survey questionnaires and structured, in-depth interviews with information/cyber security professionals.

Organizations must implement a comprehensive strategy that encompasses both fundamental defense against common attacks and cutting-edge security procedures to identify and address advanced and emerging threats if they are to manage cyber security effectively. In the study, current developments in cyber security are highlighted, including the complexity of attacks rising, the monetization of cybercrime, state-sponsored attacks, and worries over skills and capabilities.
The authors also stress the value of routinely assessing and enhancing the efficacy of security procedures. They make it clear that businesses connected to crucial or essential national infrastructure are particularly exposed to online assaults. Therefore, it's crucial to look into and put in place control measures to reduce these risks.

Overall the urgent need for businesses to prioritize cyber security in the digital age, given the complexity and sophistication of cyberattacks and their potential impact on business operations, data privacy, reputation, and national security.
