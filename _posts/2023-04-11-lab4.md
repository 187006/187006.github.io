Given how reliant businesses are on digitization, the security implications of the digital economy are a crucial concern. A company that uses only digital technology and processes to accomplish its business objectives is known as a fully digital venture.

An entirely digital business faces a number of cybersecurity issues and concerns. These difficulties include data security, preventing data loss, safeguarding vital infrastructure, and guaranteeing adherence to rules and standards. Managing identities and access privileges, as well as protecting against cyberattacks like phishing, malware, and ransomware, are further issues.

There are also a number of cyber security difficulties for a conventional brick-and-mortar SME that seeks to transform into a digital business. To supply the required digital resources, such a business must establish a strong infrastructure. Additionally, a reliable strategy must be put into It must also implement a solid security strategy to protect itself from cyber attacks and data loss.

I agree with the views of Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic (2018) agree that security plays a central role in the digital economy. Especially considering the global energy crisis in 2022, which has led to a rise in cyber attacks, it is more important than ever that companies improve their security measures and protect their digital infrastructure.

### Reflection

Significant cybersecurity issues are raised by the modern economy's increasing reliance on digitalization. Businesses face difficulties when it comes to protecting data, preventing loss, securing infrastructure, and following rules. It can be overwhelming to keep up with technological changes at their quick speed, and businesses must do so in order to counter new dangers. If these issues aren't resolved, companies run the risk of being harmed. In this quick-paced era of digital transformation, it is essential to remain aware and pro-active in adopting robust security measures to protect against new threats.
