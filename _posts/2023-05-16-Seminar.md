The lesson today was happy to have a guest lecturer who led engaging exercises with us and gave an informative seminar on the ARDUINO platform. I'm eager to share a few pictures from this informative and helpful session with you.
### One experiment was a traffic light 
#### what we used for this project:
```
 JUMPER CABLES/WIRES
 LEDS(RED, YELLOW,GREEN)
 BREADBOARD
 USB CABLE 
 RESISTANCE

### The Coding Part
To interact with sensors, actuators, and other connected devices, microcontroller boards like the Arduino Uno are programmed using the Arduino programming language.
 The language is based on C++, and the program is called Arduino IDE and includes a compiler.

In this picture you can see the code for the press button:

### Refleciton:

I received some pictures from my friends. I didn't take all the pictures myself, as mine weren't as good as the ones I received.
We had a great opportunity to learn more about ARDUINO and to see some of its practical applications during the session. We were expertly guided through a variety of experiments by our special guest educator so that we could understand the ARDUINO boards' principles and functionality. We had the chance to research different sensors, actuators, and coding techniques, which broadened our understanding of electronics and programming.


The seminar was very engaging, which made it both fun and educational. We were encouraged by the instructor's enthusiasm and knowledge, which also generated our interest and sparked several interesting discussions. Through hands-on experimentation, we gained a better understanding of how ARDUINO can be used to generate original concepts and automate various processes.


Overall, the session was an excellent educational experience that increased our perspectives on ARDUINO. It not only increased our technical skills but also motivated us to look into additional opportunities in this fascinating industry. We are grateful for the opportunity to learn from a teacher with such a wealth of knowledge, and we look forward to applying what we have learned in the future.
