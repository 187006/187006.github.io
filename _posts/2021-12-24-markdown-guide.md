#Reflection

Since I had no prior knowledge of the tasks at hand and had no idea how to proceed, I initially ran into a number of obstacles that I found difficult to overcome. I didn't know exactly what was expected of me, and some of the tasks were so foreign to me that it took a lot of effort for me to understand them.
BUt with a lot of research and testing, I was able to solve the problems, and everything worked out in the end.
I must admit that learning new material, especially in this field where I don't have much experience, was both challenging and rewarding.
