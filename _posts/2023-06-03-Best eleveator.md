|Phase	|Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
|Reconnaissance|Gathering information about the target|Restrict the quantity of data that may be accessed online.-|
|Weaponization|Creating a payload and bundling it with an exploit|- Make use of multiple-factor authentication- Addressing software and hardware flaws- Implement intrusion detection and prevention measures|Metasploit<br>- ExploitDB|
|Delivery|Sending the payload to the target|Use email filters and firewalls- Provide staff with security awareness training|Email Clients|
|Exploitation|Running the exploit and delivering the payload|impose access restrictions on administrative accountsApplication whitelisting should be implemented.- Implement intrusion detection and prevention measures|ExploitDB|
|Installation|Installing the malware on the target system|- Prevent unauthorized access to administrative accountsApplication whitelisting should be implemented.- Implement intrusion detection and prevention measures| PowerShell|
|Command and Control|Establishing communication with the attacker's server|- Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems and firewalls.- Keep an eye on network traffic- Employ intrusion detection and prevention technologies that are host-based| Wireshark<br>- Snort|
|Actions on Objectives|Performing malicious activities on the target system|- Employ mechanisms for endpoint detection and response.- Isolate infected systems.- Reimage infected computers.|Sysinternals Suite|
