|Project |Best Elevator|
|:-----------|:-----------|
|Increase customer loyalty|Increase customer loyalty: By installing IoT sensors in elevators, real-time data can be obtained to monitor elevator performance and anticipate any difficulties ahead of time. This enables the organization to deliver predictive maintenance services, minimizing downtime and increasing customer happiness. Additionally, an IoT-enabled elevator system with temperature sensors ensures ideal comfort and safety by automatically controlling the temperature inside the cabin, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.|
|Improve service maintenance and predictive maintenance |Elevator factors such as motor temperature, vibration, and usage patterns can be continually monitored by IoT sensors. This data can be evaluated to discover anomalies or future failures, allowing for preventative maintenance and lowering the possibility of unexpected breakdowns.|- 
|Manage spare parts inventory more efficiently|The organization can track spare parts utilization in real time using IoT-enabled inventory management. Automatic reordering or warnings can be triggered when inventory levels hit a specified threshold, ensuring that replacement parts are available when needed without incurring excessive inventory carrying costs.|
|Improve product design and technician training |Internet of Things sensors can collect performance data from elevators in use, providing useful insights for product design improvements. Furthermore, the data obtained can be used to improve technician training programs by mimicking real-world events and allowing for more effective troubleshooting and repairs.|
|Improve uptime and field service efficiency|Remote monitoring facilitated by IoT enables real-time observation of elevator status and performance. This enables the organization to proactively identify faults, assign field service workers quickly, and optimize their routes for efficient maintenance and repairs, ultimately enhancing uptime and reducing response times.|
|Allocate scarce service technicians more efficiently|Using IoT data, technicians' schedules may be optimized and assigned depending on priority, proximity, and competence. This guarantees that service technicians are deployed effectively, shortening response times and increasing productivity.|- 
|Communicate more effectively with suppliers|The elevator company can develop real-time communication links with suppliers using IoT-enabled supply chain management. This allows them to share information about inventory levels, order status, and maintenance needs, allowing for shorter response times and more effective coordination.|-

## Refelction 
I find it fascinating how the Internet of Things can be applied and how important it has become for businesses looking to improve their operational procedures and relationships with customers. IoT plays a significant role in improving products and services, and I believe that with the help of AI, its potential will keep growing. We are entering a new era of autonomous work, which can be both frightening and exhilarating. Moreover, it's fascinating to note that IoT is not limited to industrial applications; it is also making a difference in our private lives as well. I'm excited to see how IoT will improve and change the way we live.
