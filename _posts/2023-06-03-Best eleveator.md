|Project |Best Elevator|
|:-----------|:-----------|
|Increase customer loyalty| By installing IoT sensors in elevators, real-time data can be obtained to monitor elevator performance and anticipate any difficulties ahead of time. This enables the organization to deliver predictive maintenance services, minimizing downtime and increasing customer happiness. Additionally, an IoT-enabled elevator system with temperature sensors ensures ideal comfort and safety by automatically controlling the temperature inside the cabin, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.|
|Improve service maintenance and predictive maintenance |Elevator factors such as motor temperature, vibration, and usage patterns can be continually monitored by IoT sensors. This data can be evaluated to discover anomalies or future failures, allowing for preventative maintenance and lowering the possibility of unexpected breakdowns.|- 
|Manage spare parts inventory more efficiently|The organization can track spare parts utilization in real time using IoT-enabled inventory management. Automatic reordering or warnings can be triggered when inventory levels hit a specified threshold, ensuring that replacement parts are available when needed without incurring excessive inventory carrying costs.|
|Improve product design and technician training |Internet of Things sensors can collect performance data from elevators in use, providing useful insights for product design improvements. Furthermore, the data obtained can be used to improve technician training programs by mimicking real-world events and allowing for more effective troubleshooting and repairs.|
|Improve uptime and field service efficiency|Remote monitoring facilitated by IoT enables real-time observation of elevator status and performance. This enables the organization to proactively identify faults, assign field service workers quickly, and optimize their routes for efficient maintenance and repairs, ultimately enhancing uptime and reducing response times.|
|Allocate scarce service technicians more efficiently|Technician schedules could be optimized and designated according to IoT information that was collected and analysed. This makes sure that service technicians are efficiently used to reduce response times and increase productivity.|- 
|Communicate more effectively with suppliers|Using IoT-enabled supply chain management, the elevator company may establish real-time communication connections with its suppliers. This allows them to share details regarding inventory levels, the status of orders, and maintenance requirements, leading to quicker responses and more effective coordination.|-

##  Reflection 
I believe it’s exciting how (IoT) can be utilized and how essential it is for businesses aiming to improve their business processes and client relationships. IoT plays a crucial role in enhancing products and services, and I firmly believe that with the assistance of AI, its potential will only continue to grow. I think we are on the brink of entering a new era of autonomous work, which can be both intimidating and exhilarating. It is intimidating because it may eliminate numerous job opportunities, yet it is also exciting because it has the potential to improve nearly every aspect of our lives. It is also worth noting that IoT is not only used in the industrial sector and it also found a way in our every life and it has already had a huge positive impact on our personal lives. I am eagerly waiting for how the Internet of Things will progress and changes life.
