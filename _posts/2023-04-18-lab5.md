Software security is governed by two organizations: the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). While IEEE oversees all software security, OWASP focuses on web application security. The top 10 vulnerabilities that businesses should give priority while creating and testing software are listed by both groups.
```
The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for 2023 are:
