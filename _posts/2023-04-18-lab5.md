Hello everyone in this lab, I will talk about the top 10 vulnerabilities. Originally, our question was to find the top vulnerabilities for OWASP and IEEE, but I couldn't find any information specifically related to IEEE. Therefore, I will focus on the OWASP vulnerabilities from 2021 and 2023. But before that, I will provide a short introduction about both institutions.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) are both nonprofit organizations. While IEEE oversees all software security, OWASP focuses specifically on web application security. Both organizations work with a variety of different companies, most of which are technology and security companies.
```
The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for 2021 are:
1: Broken Access Control
2: Cryptographic Failures
3: Injection
4: Insecure Design
5: Security Misconfiguration
6: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7: Identification and Authentication Failures
8: Software and Data Integrity Failures
9: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
0: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
```
```
The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for 2022 are:
1: Broken Access Control
2: Cryptographic Failures
3: Injection
4: Insecure Design
5: Security Misconfiguration
6: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7: Identification and Authentication Failures
8: Software and Data Integrity Failures
9: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
```
If you compare both lists, you'll notice that they are the same, indicating that the list hasn't changed. With that in mind, I decided to provide a brief description for each point to explain why they are considered so dangerous.
```
1: Broken Access Control: this is a major cause of security failures, as it allows unauthorized parties to gain access to protected systems and user accounts, leaving sensitive data at risk. 
2: Cryptographic Failures: any type of leak or breach due to issues with encryption.
3: Injection: occurs when malware or trusted code is used in a way that makes it possible for attackers to change the purpose of essential commands. These injection attacks take advantage of coding flaws that allow input from invalidated users.
4: Insecure Design: mindset requires threat modelling, secure design patterns, and reference architectures.
5: Security Misconfiguration: Security settings are often left in default mode, allowing websites to become vulnerable.
6: Vulnerable and Outdated Components: using outdated components instead of patching known vulnerabilities. Although this method is undoubtedly more practical, these components are loaded with weaknesses that cybercriminals can then take advantage of.
7: Identification and Authentication Failures: When there are flaws or gaps in security controls, user identification and authentication processes are at risk of vulnerabilities.
8: Software and Data Integrity Failures: refer to a group of errors or weaknesses in software systems that have to do with the reliability and integrity of the code and data.
9: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Failures in security logging and monitoring refer to a group of vulnerabilities and flaws associated with insufficient logging and monitoring processes in an application or system.
10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): this is a vulnerability that lets attackers trick the server into sending unexpected requests, possibly accessing sensitive data or getting around security measures.
```
### Reflection
As I explained earlier, I couldn't find any information for IEEE, so I improvised and added the new list of OWASP vulnerabilities. Through my research, I learned more about OWASP and what they're doing, and I must say it's nice to have an organization that tries to help people, organizations, or companies improve web security. Sadly, not everyone is up to date with the newest vulnerabilities, so it is important to have organizations like OWASP that can assist you.
Also, it is interesting to see what the top 10 vulnerabilities are. Of course, that doesn't mean you should only focus on them. There are still other vulnerabilities you should pay attention to.
Overall, it's nice to have organizations that are trying their best to help with cybersecurity. It's also really important to check the list and take steps to prevent malicious individuals from taking advantage. The list itself is a good starting point, but you should not solely focus on it. There are still plenty of vulnerabilities that require action. It is important to regularly check not only the OWASP list but also other websites to gather information about new vulnerabilities and measures against them.
