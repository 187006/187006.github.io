Meetings

Ramzy alshfhw, a classmate of mine (student ID: 13249439), and I made the choice to collaborate on this project on a regular basis. We thought that working together would make it simpler as well as productive. It was helpful to have a variety of opinions on various topics because it improved our understanding as well as made the assignment more enjoyable. Collaboration was helpful and improved our project as a whole.
