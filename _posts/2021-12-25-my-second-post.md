## Introductionto IoT and Cyber Security

The aim of this course is to express why cybersecurity is a societal imperative; analyze the tradeoffs of balancing key
security properties like confidentiality, integrity, and availability; contrast the roles of prevention, deterrence, and
detection mechanisms; document the role of formal methods in creating high assurance software and systems; express
the differences between vulnerabilities, threats, and risk; analyze a security policy and/or procedure to show where it
considers, or fails to consider, human factors; contrast encryption, digital signatures, and hash functions; document
standards that apply to an organizationâ€™s information security posture; contrast the internet of things with the web of
things, with industrial internet, with pervasive computing, and with smart systems; illustrate ways to interface an IoT
component to sensors and actuators; demonstrate several security issues and challenges of collaborative data acquisition
in IoT; express the design and implementation issues related to ad hoc networks and contrast the difference between
proactive, reactive and hybrid routing; express intelligent information discovery, retrieval, and mining on IoT and express
tools that are using in designing IoT.
