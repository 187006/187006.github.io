## Introduction 

Welcome to my e-portfolio! The following web page represents an overview of my progress along with achievements within my course Itec442, I would like to make use of this platform to demonstrate the abilities, information, and experiences I've acquired while learning.
You can find a collection of my work, assignments, and projects that show how I've progressed in this e-portfolio. It displays my commitment, passion for it, and dedication to it.

As you navigate through the different parts of my e-portfolio, you will get insight into my learning objectives, achievements, and knowledge I have gained.
 I've included reflections on the tasks and assignments, expressing my thoughts, my struggles, and the things I've learned. In order to make the e-portfolio enjoyable and informative, I have also added components like visual presentations, and interactive elements.
I appreciate you visiting my e-portfolio, and I hope you find it informative. Also under this, you can find a description of the course.

## Descripton 

The aim of this course is to express why cybersecurity is a societal imperative; analyze the tradeoffs of balancing key
security properties like confidentiality, integrity, and availability; contrast the roles of prevention, deterrence, and
detection mechanisms; document the role of formal methods in creating high assurance software and systems; express
the differences between vulnerabilities, threats, and risk; analyze a security policy and/or procedure to show where it
considers, or fails to consider, human factors; contrast encryption, digital signatures, and hash functions; document
standards that apply to an organizationâ€™s information security posture; contrast the internet of things with the web of
things, with industrial internet, with pervasive computing, and with smart systems; illustrate ways to interface an IoT
component to sensors and actuators; demonstrate several security issues and challenges of collaborative data acquisition
in IoT; express the design and implementation issues related to ad hoc networks and contrast the difference between
proactive, reactive and hybrid routing; express intelligent information discovery, retrieval, and mining on IoT and express
tools that are using in designing IoT.
