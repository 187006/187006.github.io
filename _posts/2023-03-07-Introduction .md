## Descripton 

The aim of this course is to express why cybersecurity is a societal imperative; analyze the tradeoffs of balancing key security properties like confidentiality, integrity, and availability; Compare the functions of the mechanisms for detection, deterrence, and prevention; record how formal methods are used to create high-assurance software and systems; describe the variations between risks, threats, and vulnerabilities; analyze a security policy or procedure to show where it takes human factors into account or not; Compare and contrast hash functions, digital signatures, and encryption; standards for an organization's information security posture should be documented; 
Compare the internet of things to the industrial internet, the web of things, pervasive computing, and smart systems; describe how to connect an IoT component to sensors and actuators; demonstrate a number of security issues and difficulties with cooperative IoT data acquisition; describe the challenges involved in the design and implementation of ad hoc networks and compare proactive, reactive, and hybrid routing; express tools used in IoT design as well as intelligent information discovery, retrieval, and mining.
