|Phase	|Description|	Possible Mitigations|Tools|
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------
|Reconnaissance|Gathering information about the target|Restrict the quantity of data that may be accessed online.- Keep an eye out on social media for information leaks.- Provide staff with security awareness training|- WHOIS Lookup<br>- Google Dorks|
|Weaponization|Creating a payload and bundling it with an exploit|- Make use of multiple-factor authentication- Addressing software and hardware flaws- Implement intrusion detection and prevention measures|Metasploit<br>- ExploitDB|
|Delivery|Sending the payload to the target|Use email filters and firewalls- Provide staff with security awareness training|Email Clients|
|Exploitation|Running the exploit and delivering the payload|impose access restrictions on administrative accountsApplication whitelisting should be implemented.- Implement intrusion detection and prevention measures|ExploitDB|
|Installation|Installing the malware on the target system|- Prevent unauthorized access to administrative accountsApplication whitelisting should be implemented.- Implement intrusion detection and prevention measures| PowerShell|
|Command and Control|Establishing communication with the attacker's server|- Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems and firewalls.- Keep an eye on network traffic- Employ intrusion detection and prevention technologies that are host-based| Wireshark<br>- Snort|
|Actions on Objectives|Performing malicious activities on the target system|- Employ mechanisms for endpoint detection and response.- Isolate infected systems.- Reimage infected computers.|Sysinternals Suite|


We have identified every phase of the Cyber Kill Chain for the SolarWinds hack.
Potential Solutions:
Specify how much information you can find online.
keep an eye out on social media for information leaks
implement staff security awareness training
Put multi-factor authentication to use.
Identify and fix software and hardware flaws.
Utilize systems for intrusion detection and prevention.
Use email filters and firewalls.
Put application whitelisting into practice
Admin accounts should only have limited access.
Utilize intrusion detection and prevention systems based on hosts.
Observe the network traffic
Utilize endpoint detection and response tools.
Separate tainted systems
Reimage tainted systems

The Cyber Kill Chain has no stages that we cannot mitigate.
Tools:
Google Dorks and WHOIS Lookup for reconnaissance
Exploiting and weaponizing Metasploit and ExploitDB
Customers through email for delivery
installing PowerShell
Command and control with Wireshark and Snort
Sysinternals Suite for Objective-Based Actions
In conclusion, companies should deploy a mix of technical and non-technical measures to minimize the SolarWinds attack utilizing the Cyber Kill Chain. The Cyber Kill Chain offers a framework for comprehending the many stages of a cyberattack and ranking the essential mitigation tactics. Businesses may strengthen their security posture and lower the chance of successful cyberattacks by adopting the tools and mitigation methods listed in the table above.
