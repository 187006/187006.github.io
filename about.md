## About


Hello and welcome to my about me page! My name is Beytullah Gezginci and I am a 24-year-old student studying Information Technology. I am currently in my final semester, set to graduate in the spring of 2023.

During my studies, I was fortunate enough to participate in an internship in this field, where I was able to gain valuable experience and knowledge. Additionally, I have experience in programming languages such as Python, SQL, and a bit of C++.

If you would like to contact me, you can do so by writing me an email at 18700616@outlook.com. I am also currently taking a course in cyber security and IoT, so I have some knowledge in these areas as well.

I am always eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge in the field of Information Technology. I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and make the world a better place.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page and learn a bit more about me. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities to collaborate.
